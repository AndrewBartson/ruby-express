# Chapter 10 - Exercise 14
# In exercise 12, we manually set the contacts hash values 
# one by one. Now, programmatically loop or iterate 
# over the contacts hash from exercise 12, 
# and populate the associated data from the contact_data array. 
# Hint: Iterate over ([:email, :address, :phone]), 
# Hint: Try Array methods "shift" and "first".

# Note that this exercise is only concerned with 
# dealing with 1 entry in the contacts hash, like this:

# contact_data = ["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"]
# contacts = {"Joe Smith" => {}}

# Extra credit - Figure out how to make it work with multiple 
# entries in the contacts hash.
