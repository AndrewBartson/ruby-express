# Chapter 6 - Exercise 7
# Write a program that iterates over an array and 
# builds a new array in which each value in the original is
# incremented by a value of 2. 
# After running this program, you should have two arrays:
#  - the original array
#  - the new array you created
# Print both arrays to the screen using the p method instead of puts.
